- When I accidentally drag the mouse into the modal, it closes. Why?
- Search might want "search in this label" feature
- Search should include results where search term is in a label.
- Consider making a demo account.
- Order of pinned notes is odd. Should they render in the order they were pinned?
- Fix whitespace in search, ex: "test " should still give "test" results back.
- If search is blank, show zero search results, not all notes.
- Add comments to hooks describing what they do, return vals and args.
- Show "edited at" time and date
