- When I accidentally drag the mouse into the modal, it closes. Why?
- When user navigates away from search, does it clear the search bar?
- CSS for search bar sucks
- Search might want "search in this label" feature
- Search should include results where search term is in a label.
- Break note content into its own element so that I can highlight search terms.
  Will need to use "dangerously set inner html", and "dompurify" package.

  - Consider making a demo account.
